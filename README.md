Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis financial is a financial services company that creates financial plans for customers. The comapny wanted me to address software vulnerabilities and ensure their applications follow secure coding standards.
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
What I did well was identifying and solving vulnerabilities using vulnerability assessments. I was able to find encryption issues, and ensured data handling weas done securely and correctly. 
Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
What was challenging was finding dependencies and confirming that libraries were secure. Using OWASP dependency check was huge, and found many culnerabilities easily, as well as having potential solutions. 
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased layers of security by adding encryption algorithms. In the future, I would use OWASP, and using static code analysis to mitigate risks. 
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I tested the app to make sure that it still functioned as intended. I also rerean OWASP checks to make suyre no new vulnerabilities were detected, if they were I would fix those also.
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I used OWASP dependency check, as well as industry secure coding standards, as well as Java's libraries. All of these will be helpful in the future.
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show future employers a vulnerability assessment and a report of these. Refactored code showing it is secure, as well as highlighing my secure coding practices.
